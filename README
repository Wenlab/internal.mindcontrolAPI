The MindControl API is a DLL and associated .h header file that allows other 
software to read and write certain information from the MindControl software
side-by-side in real-time as the mindcontrol software runs. 

For example, the following C code will display the current frame number from
a running MindControl process, provided that it can access the mc_api.dll file.


#include <stdio.h>
#include "mc_api_dll.h"

int main(){
	SharedMemory_t sm= MC_API_StartClient();
	int f= MC_API_GetCurrentFrame(sm);
	printf("Current frame is %d\n.",f);
	MC_API_StopClient(sm);
	return 0;
}


The mc_api.dll file is generated by running make and is located in bin/.

The MindContol API rests on top of a more general memory sharing library called
InterProcess available at http://github.com/samuellab/InterProcess
